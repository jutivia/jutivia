<!-- ### Hi there 👋
I am Jumoke 
I am a chemical engineer by degree,
My side hstle is withcraft
I suck blood for a living
I am also a part-time zombie
I really love catfish
I would love to connect with you
To join my coven, Just say hi 3x while holding you hannd to you hand and stamping your feet on the ground simultaneously
If this doesn't work, you can always reach our coven's customer care unit, by screaming "Jutivia" 5 times
If this still don't work, it means the coven doesn't like you spirit.
